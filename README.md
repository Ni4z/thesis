Master Thesis for MSc Data Science in Economics program from University of Paderborn.

## Thesis Topic:
Modeling and forecasting trend- or scale-stationary time series under short or long memory applied to economic, financial and environmental data.


In this thesis I have developed time series models for both short-memory (ARMA, ARIMA) and long-memory processes (using SEMIFAR and fractional differencing techniques), analyzed and forecasted economic, financial, and environmental data, including economic indicators, ETF trading volumes, natural gas consumption, and vehicle miles traveled, explored the role of the fractional differencing parameter in capturing long-range dependence, demonstrated and compared linear (LM) and scale-stationary (SM) trend models for real-world datasets.
